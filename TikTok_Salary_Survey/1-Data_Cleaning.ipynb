    "# Providing Context:\n",
    "In 2021, a survey was conducted on TikTok to promote salary transparency and assist college students and employees in exploring career options and earning potential. Participants were asked to enter their salary and other information in a shared Google Sheets document, resulting in over 80,000 entries. Because this was an unstructured survey, answers lacked defined responses and standardized formatting. The survey contained irrelevant,incomplete responses and misspellings posing challenges for data cleaning and ensuring data integrity. Analyzing the data required extensive manual effort, including coding, categorizing, and interpreting responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The responses to the survey were first processed in an SSIS package and loaded and then grouped into age ranges which was then loaded respectively into SQL tables and separate CSV files to speed up processing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on cleaning the data to prepare for visualization and machine learning models that will be performed in other notebooks. This is to help with readability."

    "\n",
    "1.\tData Loading and Initial Exploration: Load the survey data to understand the structure, identify any apparent issues, and get a sense of the cleaning required.\n",
    "2.\tData Cleaning and Standardization: Clean the survey data by addressing missing values, correcting misspellings, standardizing categorical columns, and ensuring data types are appropriate and consistent for analysis.\n",
    "3.\tCategorization of all columns to standardize and preprocess them for machine learning modles. This will be broken down by column given the amount of processing each column requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For categorization:**\n",
    "1. Rename `Highest level of Education`, correct misspellings and group `Education` into categories.\n",
    "2. Reduce redundancy by group the `Industry` and `Job Title` columns. This will require some web scrapping and manual mapping.\n",
    "3. Correct and standardize misspellings in the `Country` column. \n",
    "4. Then Convert all salary columns into USD based on country's conversion rate to ensure accuracy and consistency. Currency conversion rates and country codes will be gotten through web scrapping as well.\n",
    "5. Finalize by grouping `Gender` column.\n"
