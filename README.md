# Data Science Projects
Welcome to the Data Science Project repository! This repository contains some of my datascience projects. They each offer insights and analyses across diverse domains. My projects range from exploratory data analysis to predictive modeling and machine learning applications, all aimed at solving problems, and driving informed decision-making and furthering my skill set. Each dataset is chosen based on my interests and the skills I want to learn.

1. [Data Analysis, Salary and Gender Prediction](https://github.com/v-acha/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/TikTok_Salary_Survey)
   - **Description:** This project entails analyzing salary data gathered from a TikTok survey to predict salary amounts based on various categories and gender, using specific variables as predictors.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data analysis and visualizations. XGBoost for salary prediction and Random Classification for gender prediction.
   - **Results:** The XGBoost regression model achieved an R-squared of 0.60 for predicting salary amounts and The Random Classification model achieved an accuracy of 0.81 for predicting gender.

2. [Shoe Price Prediction](https://github.com/v-acha/Data_Science_Projects/tree/main/shoe_price_prediction)
   - **Description:** This project involves analyzing shoe price data from datafiniti to predict average prices based on various categories and conditions using specific variables as predictors.
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks use Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for applying PCA and building Random Forest regression, Linear regression, and Ridge regression models.
   - **Results:** The Ridge regression model, incorporating all three features (prices.amountMin, prices.amountMax, and avg_price), achieved the lowest MAE of 0.0106, effectively predicting shoe prices with high accuracy. The Linear regression model had a higher MAE of 7.1357, while the Random Forest regression model achieved an MAE of 0.07153.
